Styrbar remote device handler

First try at creating a device handler for the IKEA Styrbar four (4) buttons remote.
What works:
- Button presses for all four buttons
- Button holds for up/down (dim up/down)

What doesn't work:
-Left/right generate the same data when held. IKEA envisioned those buttons to reset the bulb color
