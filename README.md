# SmartThings-Styrbar
Styrbar remote device handler for smartthings

First try at creating a device handler for the IKEA Styrbar four (4) buttons remote.
What works:
- Button presses for all four buttons
- Button holds for up/down (dim up/down)

What doesn't work:
- Left/right generate the same data when held. IKEA envisioned those buttons to reset the bulb color

This may stop working at any time for any reason, that is just the way it is with Samsung Smartthings. ;-)
It's probably going to stop working for me at the same time as you.


# Install instructions

Not going to write any as this is a relatively simple device handler, this will get you on your way.
